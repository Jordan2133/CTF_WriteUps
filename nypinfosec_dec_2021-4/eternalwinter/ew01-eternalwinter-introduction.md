## The Challenge
Opening up the image, we can clearly see a line of binary at the bottom of the image.

Binary: `1001110 1011001 1010000 1111011 1100111 1110010 0110000 1110101 1101110 1100100 1011010 0110011 1110010 1001111 1111101`

First thing that comes to mind when finding a binary string is to try to convert it to ASCII.

Convert the [binary to ASCII text](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/binary-to-ascii.html) and you get the flag. There are many online tools on the web that you can use to convert binary to ASCII.

flag = `NYP{gr0undZ3rO}`

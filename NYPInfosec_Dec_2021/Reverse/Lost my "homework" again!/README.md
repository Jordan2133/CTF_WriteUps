# Description
>Oh no! A virus just stole my master key to my homework folder and encrypted it! It looks like it ran 2 different functions on my master key and gave me back a whole mess of numbers in txt.txt.

>Thankfully, I managed to find the virus programs, but I don't understand the code at all! Could you help me retrieve my master key again so I can continue doing my "homework"?

We are also given 4 different files for the challenge.

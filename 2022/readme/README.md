# ðŸ‘¾ STANDCON 2022

Overall, this was one of the most unique CTFs I have participated in; it required the use of a game platform called [Gather Town](https://app.gather.town/app) to gather keys to unlock the challenges, as well as 'fishes' to unlock hints and other stuff.

However, most of the challenges were pretty guessy, which is the downside of this CTF.

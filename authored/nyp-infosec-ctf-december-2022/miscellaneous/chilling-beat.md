## Description

> This looks like a fun file filled with cool beats. Enjoy the song while you can!

{% file src="../../../.gitbook/assets/ChillingBeat.osz" %}

## Solution

### TL;DR

1. Notice file is a osu beatmap file
2. Download osu and import the file into the game
3. Go into edit mode and scroll through the beatmap, flag characters are all in green.

### Analysis

We can search up what is an `.osz` file and [some sites](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/662852?n=1) tell us that it is used in a game called **Osu!** and how to open it.

Download **Osu!**, then drag and drop the `.osz` file into the game to import the beatmap.

We can play through the map, and see the flag format shown in green at the start of the map

So we can assume the other letters are the same.

You can try to play through the map to get each character, or you can just go into **Edit** mode and scroll through the map.

We can then see a pattern, where only the green parts are part of the flag.

So we can just scroll through the map to get every character :)

# ðŸ‘€ Lag and Crash 2023

In my honest opinion, this CTF contains a lot of guessy challenges and very little of those challenges that test your technical skills. My team, `dad`, still managed to take the top spot, just barely winning by 12 points.

Regardless, here are writeups for some of the challenges.

## Challenges

### Crypto

| Challenge  | Points |
